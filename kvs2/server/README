an ugly server using epool looking like Event-DrivenServer but actually...
process:non real-time model, no async interface, no stream interface

L1:epoll queue [     ]
L2:job queue [    ]
L3:fetch worker-thread []  thread_func_callback


final destination: hope to DenyOfService in L1 when L1 || L2 || L3 .. temporary leak of source.
